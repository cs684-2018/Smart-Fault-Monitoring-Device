Project Description:
Aim of this project is to design a Smart Fault Monitoring Device, which can be used for monitoring the trip/fault status across MCB in domestic and industrial applications.
•	Unit will monitor the mains supply & MCB trip contact status. There can be any one of the following states:
	o	Power OK:  means voltages on Primary & Secondary side of MCB are OK.
	o	No Power: means incoming Mains supply is not present.
	o	MCB Tripped: means MCB has got tripped due to overload or short circuit current etc.
•	Unit will log above trip information and intimate to user using IoT device along with current & voltage values.
